# Headloose

Headloose is kind of a JavaScript CMS with an own file format for exchanging content and aiming at generating static HTML / JSON. Know what I mean?

The GUI is written in Angular (currently 9.x) and the backend is an Koa/Apollo/MongoDB trio. Everything is dockerized.

This is my playground where I can develop and test ideas, experiment with new stuff and play around. This is NOWHERE ready for primetime and who knows if it will ever be.

A preview of the current working state can be seen [here](https://brunofenzl.github.io/headloose/)

If you already have docker installed, clone this repo and run `docker-compose build && docker-compose up`.
